League of legends external python orbwalker 

This script was mainly an experiemnt, though a functional kiting script for league of legends.
The commented out section is the target selection module, which uses pixel scanning to only attack champions, though it's slower.
The main module is just groundclick kiting.

Setup:
-Install the required modules
-Set your attack move button to middle click in your league of legends hotkey settings
(optional) - Set your target champs only to space, and don't enable the "toggle" option for it

Configuration:
Set your avearage ping as the ping variable
The lower the movefactor, the less you move between attacks (looks cooler on high attack speed but I'd keep in on 0.9 for practical use)
The windup can be changed based on champion but generally spekaing that's a good universal value.
